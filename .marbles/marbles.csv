m-643c,cm query flag order confusing,Tried 'cm query find_untested --exact' but got error. Flag must come BEFORE symbol name. Natural to put flags after positional args.

m-2e7a,cm callers/callees need --limit flag,cm query has --limit flag but callers/callees don't. These commands can also return huge output. Add --limit N flag to cap results for token efficiency.,closed,1,opus,opus,Pi,2025-12-29T14:45:11.573Z,2025-12-30T03:06:01.667Z,,
m-7fa8,cm query fails on Rust enum variants and command names,Tried 'cm query Implements' to find the Implements command struct but got 'No symbols found'. Tree-sitter doesn't index enum variants or command structs. Makes it hard to navigate clap Command enums.
